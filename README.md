# CarDekho Data Analysis Project
This project focuses on analyzing two datasets, car_price.csv and car_km.csv, as part of a data analysis exercise. 
The aim was to derive insights and answer specific questions using both SQL and Python. The workflow involved the following key steps:

## Key Features of the Project
### SQL Query Execution:
- Ran SQL queries on the datasets to address predefined analytical questions.
- Utilized SQL's capabilities for data manipulation and filtering.

### SQL-Python Integration:
- Established a connection between SQL and Jupyter Notebook.
- Imported query results into Python for advanced data analysis.

### Pandas Query Implementation:
- Translated SQL logic into Python using Pandas.
- Wrote queries and performed data wrangling to extract meaningful insights.
.

### Tools and Technologies Used
- SQL for querying the datasets.
- Python (Pandas, Jupyter Notebook) for data processing and analysis.
- Jupyter Notebook as the primary interface for writing and running code.

### Insights and Outcomes
- Answered analytical questions efficiently using SQL and Pandas.
- Gained hands-on experience with SQL-Python integration.
- Improved skills in data analysis and problem-solving using two complementary technologies.

### Project Structure
- car_price.csv: Contains price-related data of cars.
- car_km.csv: Contains distance (kilometers) data of cars.
- notebooks/: Jupyter notebooks with SQL queries, Python code, and detailed analysis.
