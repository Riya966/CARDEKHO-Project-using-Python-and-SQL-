# CarDekho Data Analysis Project
This project focuses on analyzing two datasets, car_price.csv and car_km.csv, as part of a data analysis exercise. The aim was to derive insights and answer specific questions using both SQL and Python. The workflow involved the following key steps:

Key Features of the Project
SQL Query Execution:

Ran SQL queries on the datasets to address predefined analytical questions.
Utilized SQL's capabilities for data manipulation and filtering.
SQL-Python Integration:

Established a connection between SQL and Jupyter Notebook.
Imported query results into Python for advanced data analysis.
Pandas Query Implementation:

Translated SQL logic into Python using Pandas.
Wrote queries and performed data wrangling to extract meaningful insights.
Data Analysis & Visualization:

Conducted a thorough analysis to uncover patterns and trends.
Generated visualizations to summarize findings (if applicable).
Tools and Technologies Used
SQL for querying the datasets.
Python (Pandas, Jupyter Notebook) for data processing and analysis.
Jupyter Notebook as the primary interface for writing and running code.
Insights and Outcomes
Answered analytical questions efficiently using SQL and Pandas.
Gained hands-on experience with SQL-Python integration.
Improved skills in data analysis and problem-solving using two complementary technologies.
Project Structure
car_price.csv: Contains price-related data of cars.
car_km.csv: Contains distance (kilometers) data of cars.
notebooks/: Jupyter notebooks with SQL queries, Python code, and detailed analysis.
Feel free to explore the notebooks and datasets to understand the workflow and replicate the analysis!
